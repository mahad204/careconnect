            <h3>HealthX Africa makes high quality primary health care and wellness accessible, affordable, convenient and equal. We use the power of digital technology to reach every user with quality primary health care services wherever they are, whenever they want, and as often as they need.</h3>
<h6>We believe you should have the power to make the best health and wellness decisions for yourself and your family, not driven by cost or fear, but by what you need. Be it preventive, promotive, curative, or rehabilitative primary health care, we strive to be your constant and trusted partner on your health and wellness journey, and to support you in achieving your dreams and aspirations for yourself and your family.</h6>

<h6>Through video and voice consultations, live chat, in-person care, virtual clinics (coming soon!), and a hospital-at-home program (coming soon!), we make trusted, qualified and licensed primary health care doctors and wellness advisors available to every user, 24 hours a day, 365 days a year.</h6>

<h6>Our Nairobi-based state-of-the-art Health Control Centre is our innovation hub, where users call for an immediate medical consultation, obtain medical advice on medication, prescription, lab services, referral to local hospitals or clinics, and wellness consultations – including customised exercise and meal plans – as well as other primary health care services.</h6>
